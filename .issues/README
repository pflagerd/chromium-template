This is about putting all the same functionality as in github.com or gitlab.com into the repo itself.

The idea is that one should be able to clone the repository, do an equivalent to a python venv "activate", and one has customized cli tools (accessible by bash) and GUIs (accessible by a browser (chromium)) which require no other pre-installed tools.

This is designed for Linux (and maybe Linux on Windows).
